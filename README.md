## 1. Introduction

In addition to core Linux concepts, there are several other areas that interviewers may explore. This guide covers extra topicsâ€”from maintaining user accounts to securing disk partitions and using container technologies. Mastery of these basic concepts will help you confidently answer interview questions and manage everyday Linux operations.

## 2. User and Group Management, Authentication & Authorization

### User and Group Management

- **Creating and Managing Users:**
  ```bash
  sudo adduser john         # Create a new user (Debian/Ubuntu)
  sudo useradd john         # Alternative on some distros
  sudo passwd john          # Set or change user password
  ```

- **Managing Groups:**
  ```bash
  sudo groupadd developers  # Create a new group
  sudo usermod -aG developers john  # Add user 'john' to the 'developers' group
  grep developers /etc/group         # Verify group membership
  ```

- **Deleting Users and Groups:**
  ```bash
  sudo deluser john         # Remove a user (Debian/Ubuntu)
  sudo groupdel developers  # Remove a group
  ```

### Authentication and Authorization

- **Sudoers File:**
  - Edit `/etc/sudoers` (using `visudo`) to grant specific privileges.
  ```bash
  # Example: Allow user 'john' to run any command
  john ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
  ```

- **Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM):**
  - PAM handles authentication for Linux.
  - The file `/etc/pam.d/common-auth` (Debian/Ubuntu) or `/etc/pam.d/system-auth` (RHEL/CentOS) can be edited to tighten security.

## 3. Terminal Multiplexers

Terminal multiplexers let you manage multiple terminal sessions within one window and are particularly useful for remote work.

### Screen

- **Starting Screen:**
  ```bash
  screen
  ```
- **Detaching and Reattaching:**
  - Detach: Press `Ctrl-a` then `d`
  - List sessions: `screen -ls`
  - Reattach: `screen -r <session_id>`

### Tmux

- **Starting Tmux:**
  ```bash
  tmux
  ```
- **Splitting Windows & Sessions:**
  - Split horizontally: `Ctrl-b "`  
  - Split vertically: `Ctrl-b %`
- **Detaching and Reattaching:**
  - Detach: `Ctrl-b d`
  - List sessions: `tmux ls`
  - Reattach: `tmux attach-session -t <session_name>`

## 4. Backup and Restore Strategies

Regular backups are key for disaster recovery and system integrity.

### Using `tar` for Backup

- **Creating a Compressed Backup:**
  ```bash
  tar -czvf backup_$(date +%F).tar.gz /path/to/data
  ```
- **Restoring from a Backup:**
  ```bash
  tar -xzvf backup_2023-01-01.tar.gz -C /path/to/restore/
  ```

### Using `rsync` for Incremental Backup

- **Example Command:**
  ```bash
  rsync -avz /source/directory/ /destination/backup/
  ```
- **Advantages:**
  - Only transfers changed files.
  - Maintains file permissions and timestamps.

## 5. Basic Disk Encryption with LUKS

Encrypting disks with LUKS helps secure sensitive data.

### Setting Up LUKS

- **Encrypt a Partition:**
  ```bash
  sudo cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sdb1
  ```
- **Open an Encrypted Partition:**
  ```bash
  sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdb1 my_encrypted_drive
  ```
- **Create a Filesystem and Mount:**
  ```bash
  sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/my_encrypted_drive
  sudo mount /dev/mapper/my_encrypted_drive /mnt/encrypted
  ```

- **Closing the Encrypted Partition:**
  ```bash
  sudo umount /mnt/encrypted
  sudo cryptsetup luksClose my_encrypted_drive
  ```

## 6. Container Basics (Docker)

Containers provide lightweight, isolated environments for running applications.

### Basic Docker Commands

- **Running a Container:**
  ```bash
  docker run -d --name my_container nginx
  ```
- **Listing Containers:**
  ```bash
  docker ps -a
  ```
- **Inspecting a Container:**
  ```bash
  docker inspect my_container
  ```
- **Stopping and Removing a Container:**
  ```bash
  docker stop my_container
  docker rm my_container
  ```
- **Pulling an Image from Docker Hub:**
  ```bash
  docker pull ubuntu
  ```

## 7. Performance and Monitoring Tools

Monitoring system performance is crucial for troubleshooting and system optimization.

### Essential Tools

- **vmstat:** Provides insights into system memory, processes, and CPU.
  ```bash
  vmstat 2 5  # Report every 2 seconds, 5 times.
  ```
- **iostat:** Monitors disk I/O and CPU utilization.
  ```bash
  iostat -xz 2 3
  ```
- **sar:** Collects and reports performance data.
  ```bash
  sar -u 2 5  # Monitor CPU usage every 2 seconds for 5 iterations.
  ```
- **htop:** An interactive process viewer with better visuals than top.
  ```bash
  htop
  ```

## 8. Interview Questions & Answers

### Q1: How do you add a new user and assign a user to a group in Linux?
- **Answer:**  
  Use `adduser` or `useradd` to create a new user, and `usermod -aG groupname username` to add a user to an existing group.
  ```bash
  sudo adduser alice
  sudo usermod -aG developers alice
  ```

### Q2: What are the benefits of using a terminal multiplexer like tmux or screen?
- **Answer:**  
  They allow multiple terminal sessions to run in one window, help manage remote sessions, and facilitate session detaching and reattaching without interrupting processes.

### Q3: Explain how LUKS works for disk encryption.
- **Answer:**  
  LUKS provides a standard for disk encryption, including key management. It encrypts the entire partition, requires a passphrase to unlock, and uses the device mapper to create an encrypted block device.
  
### Q4: How does rsync differ from tar for backups?
- **Answer:**  
  `tar` creates a single archive file and is useful for one-time backups, whereas `rsync` is efficient for incremental backups, transferring only the changed parts, and preserving file permissions.

### Q5: Provide an example of a basic Docker command to run an nginx container.
- **Answer:**
  ```bash
  docker run -d --name nginx_server -p 80:80 nginx
  ```
